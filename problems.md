- [x] Guess the Word
  - [ ] revisit
- this one was tricky, purely statistical in nature. Guess, word, and guess again with words with similar matching. To reduce the pool of words, we can use the pool with the highest similarity and guess with that, and repeat 
- [ ] Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards
- can be brute forced recursively but not ideal
- Another sliding window problem. Notice how elements from left and right slide together so we can always calculate the max for each sliding windows by using DP to calculate sums for left and right upto index I from left and remaining items  from the right
- smart idea is to sum all the elements and the use a sliding window and compare the results instead of using DP. For this a sum alone is enough
